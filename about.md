My name is **Matt Stanley**, I'm 24 and I love two things (well that's kind of 
a lie, I love a lot of things) **cooking** and **computer science**. 

I recently graduated from [Middlebury College](http://www.middlebury.edu/) where I studied
computer science and mathematics. While at Middlebury I worked at a restaurant
named [American Flatbread](http://www.americanflatbread.com/), where I discovered
that food and cooking it was really cool. I split my time between things like: 
reading about the **OSI model** and researching the **Mother Sauces**. 

Currently I'm looking to dive into a **career** as a **software developer**, as well as 
contemplating **graduate school**. I'm having a lot of fun teaching myself **web development**
(python, flask, django, html, css, javascript) and am becoming passionate about
the **Internet**. It's pretty neat! To tell the truth though, I haven't met a tech topic
I didn't like. 

In the culinary world I'm hooked on dumplings, both eating and making them. If you 
have any tips, tricks or recipes, [send them my way](mailto:{{ site.data.author.email }}).
